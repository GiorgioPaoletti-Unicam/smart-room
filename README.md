# Smart Room - Drools Project

This repository contains an implementation of a Smart Room scenario, realized with smart devices, using Drools, a powerful business rules management system. The room includes a studying area, a relaxing area, and a sleeping area.

## üìÉ Project Overview

The project includes several smart devices, each of which performs a specific function. Here is the list of implemented classes:

- `Air Quality Sensor`: Monitors the air quality in the room.
- `Motion Sensor`: Detects the presence of a person in front of the desk.
- `Smart Speaker`: Can play music or function as an alarm clock.
- `Media Center`: Allows the playback of movies.
- `Smart Device`: A generic device with functions depending on the assigned name.
- `User`: Represents the presence of a person in the room.

Several rules have been defined to manage these devices and interact with the user under various conditions. These rules are meant to create a comfortable and suitable environment based on the current conditions and user's actions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

To run the program, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can use the following command to start the program:

```bash
java -jar SmartRoom.jar
```
